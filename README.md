### Installation
- On first startup, after the initial channel is loaded a scan of the miniguide will be started. <br>
  A message will be displayed "Scanning MiniGuide" which will close when the scan has completed, around 45 seconds.<br>
  After the scan has completed the data is saved in the filesystem the new channel number support is available.<br>
- Rescan MiniGuide<br>
  If the Spectrum lineup changes you will need to rescan the miniguide. This can be done in two ways.<br>
1. Uninstall and reinstall the "Spectv" package
2. From the Application settings on the device, Force stop "Spectv", Delete the application data, restart "Spectv"
